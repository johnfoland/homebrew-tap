  caveats <<~EOS
    ClaudeBar runs as a menu bar app with no Dock icon — look for its icon in
    the menu bar after launching it.

    Fork builds have Sparkle's automatic update check disabled, because the
    bundled appcast points at upstream tddworks releases and would otherwise
    replace this build with a stock one. Update through Homebrew instead:

      brew upgrade --cask johnfoland/tap/claudebar
